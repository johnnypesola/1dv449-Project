# 1dv449-Project
A mashup application for the course 1dv449 on Linnaeus University

## The Mashup, initial vision

Appname: My Climbing Trip / Climbing Companion

The application is going to be an Angular.js mobile based application (http://mobileangularui.com/). It's not going go commersial or be published on Google Play or iTunes in the first phase of development, maybe later depending on licencing issues and such.
   
I have two potential paths to follow. Focusing on both will be too time-consuming.

## Potential App functionality 

### App angle 1: News and inspiration (Maybe will be implemented partially)

#### News:
- News text from http://www.climbing.com/feed/ (rss)
- News text from http://www.rockandice.com/RSSRetrieve.aspx?ID=13126&Type=RSS20 (rss)

#### Inspiration: 
- Movies from Vimeo (API)
- TV from Youtube - Climbing daily (API)
- Pictures from climbing.iloove.it (scraped)
- Climbing Locations from climbing.iloove.it (scraped)

### App angle 2: Tools for climbing trips (This is the main focus for now)

#### Tools:
- Nearest gas stations from eniro (API) (Swedish only)
- Nearest accomodations from STR (API) (Swedish only)
- Nearest bathing sites from eniro (API) (Swedish only)
- Climbing Locations from climbing.iloove.it (scraped)
- Pictures of locations from climbing.iloove.it (scraped)
- Climbing Locations from thecrag.com (API)
- Weather info for location from yr.no (API)
- Google maps for map (API)

### Other potentioal sources:

	Twitter, instagram, google street view,
